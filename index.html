<h2>What Are Duck Nails? Understanding the Shape</h2>
<p>Duck nails are also called flared nails due to their distinctive wide tip that fans out much more than traditional nail shapes. Unlike coffin or ballerina nails that taper inward, duck nails flare outward toward the edge, resembling a duck's bill or webbed foot.</p>
<h2>Key Characteristics:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wide, flared tips</strong> that extend beyond the natural nail width</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tapered base</strong> that narrows toward the cuticle for contrast</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bold and playful silhouette</strong> that stands out compared to classic shapes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Great canvas</strong> for nail art due to extra surface area</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This shape is especially popular with acrylic nails and is favored by those who want a dramatic nail look with plenty of personality.</p>
